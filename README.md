Final Project for MGD141:

This project uses HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.

This website uses some recipes that have been given to me or some that I made myself.
Not all of the pictures are mine and are referenced in the URLS, but some of the
photos are actual pictures taken of the dishes that I've made previously in my kitchen.

A lot has changed since I started mocking up the website. It still slightly resembles
my mockups, but it is certainly different. I had to get rid of things that I thought
would look good, because they didn't. An example of this would be a side bar section
that I drew up that would have links in it. They website look really cluttered and confused.
Sometimes, less is more. I saw the requirements for the website was 6-10 pages,
so I had to reduce the amount and got it down to 11 separate pages. Only the first
or second recipe in each index are actual recipes. The rest are # links. 

Thanks!
